# Disclaimer & Ethical Use

This project (AliasMap) is unofficial and not affiliated with the Sherlock Project. It is intended for educational purposes and legitimate/authorized investigations. By continuing, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

- We only collect publicly accessible information. We do not log in, bypass controls, or interact with recovery flows beyond the initial page (single attempt, static parsing only).
- We do not persist data on the server. Results are shown only in your session; exports are local and your responsibility.
- Do not record or share third‑party PII without legal basis/consent. Respect applicable laws (e.g., GDPR/LGPD/CCPA) and each platform’s Terms of Use.
- Avoid overload: respect operational limits (concurrency/timeout) and do not attempt abusive use.

If you do not agree with these terms, do not use this tool.
